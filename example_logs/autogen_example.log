Assistant (to User):
I'll help you create a Python function to calculate factorial. Let me write the code for you.

User (to Assistant):
Please create a factorial function with proper error handling.

Assistant (to User):
I'll create a factorial function with error handling for you.

EXECUTING CODE BLOCK:
```python
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate factorial of a number with error handling."""
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be non-negative")
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Test the function
print(f"factorial(5) = {factorial(5)}")
print(f"factorial(0) = {factorial(0)}")
```

exitcode: 0
Output:
factorial(5) = 120
factorial(0) = 1

Assistant (to User):
The factorial function has been successfully created with proper error handling. It includes:
- Type checking to ensure input is an integer
- Value checking to ensure input is non-negative
- Correct handling of edge cases (0 and 1)
- Efficient iterative calculation

The test results show that factorial(5) = 120 and factorial(0) = 1, which are correct.
